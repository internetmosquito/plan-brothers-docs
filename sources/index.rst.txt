Welcome to PlanBrothers image taggers comparison's documentation!
=================================================================

This is a short documentation that depicts the most important things in this Flask-based demo project
that tries to make a comparison on several image tagging cloud services that can be found
in Internet nowadays:

* `Amazon Rekognition <https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/>`_
* `Google Computer Vision <https://cloud.google.com/vision/?hl=en>`_
* `Clarifai <https://www.clarifai.com/>`_
* `Microsoft Computer Vision <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/>`_

The objective is to check the tagging capabilities of each of those services, as well as determine
the level of accuracy of each of those. To that aim, a set of images is used in every test run, so
we can have a deterministic way to test each service.

The images can be found in the **images** folder in the root path. It is a selection of 15 pictures related
with factories and 10 pictures related with Shopping malls.

Results from this comparison are shown via a very simple web page where data is shown in a table, where columns
are used for each service and each row represents an image from the sample data. Every cell in the table contains
the tags and probability each Service has obtained for such image.

Please check the :doc:`Quick Start guide <quick-start>` to get things rolling quickly!
